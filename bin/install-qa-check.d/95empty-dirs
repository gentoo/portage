# Warn about and/or remove empty directories installed by ebuild.

# Rationale: PMS prohibits ebuilds from installing empty directories.
# Cleaning them up from the installation image provides an easy way
# to make sure that ebuilds are not relying on it while making it easy
# for users to override this if they need to.
#
# The ebuilds that need to preserve empty directories should use keepdir
# as documented e.g.:
# https://devmanual.gentoo.org/function-reference/install-functions/index.html
#
# For now, we emit QA warnings for empty directories in /var.
# Additionally, if FEATURES=strict-keepdir is enabled we explicitly
# remove *all* empty directories to trigger breakage.
