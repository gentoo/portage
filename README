About Portage
=============

Portage is a package management system based on ports collections. The
Package Manager Specification Project (PMS) standardises and documents 
the behaviour of Portage so that the Portage tree can be used by other 
package managers.


Dependencies
============

Python and Bash should be the only hard dependencies. Python 2.7 is the
minimum supported version.
