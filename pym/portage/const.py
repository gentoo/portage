# There are two types of variables here which can easily be confused,
# resulting in arbitrary bugs, mainly exposed with an offset
# installation (Prefix).  The two types relate to the usage of
# config_root or target_root.
# The first, config_root (PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT), can be a path somewhere,
# from which all derived paths need to be relative (e.g.
# USER_CONFIG_PATH) without EPREFIX prepended in Prefix.  This means
# config_root can for instance be set to "$HOME/my/config".  Obviously,
# in such case it is not appropriate to prepend EPREFIX to derived
# constants.  The default value of config_root is EPREFIX (in non-Prefix
# the empty string) -- overriding the value loses the EPREFIX as one
# would expect.
# Second there is target_root (ROOT) which is used to install somewhere
# completely else, in Prefix of limited use.  Because this is an offset
# always given, the EPREFIX should always be applied in it, hence the
# code always prefixes them with EROOT.
# The variables in this file are grouped by config_root, target_root.

# variables used with config_root (these need to be relative)
