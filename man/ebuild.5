.TH "EBUILD" "5" "Oct 2012" "Portage VERSION" "Portage"

.SH "NAME"
ebuild \- the internal format, variables, and functions in an ebuild script

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBebuild\fR(1) program accepts a single ebuild script as an argument.
This script contains variables and commands that specify how to download,
unpack, patch, compile, install and merge a particular software package from
its original sources.  In addition to all of this, the ebuild script can also
contain pre/post install/remove commands, as required.  All ebuild scripts are
written in bash.

.SS "Dependencies"
A \fIdepend atom\fR is simply a dependency that is used by portage when calculating
relationships between packages.  Please note that if the atom has not already
been emerged, then the latest version available is matched.
.TP
.B Atom Bases
The base atom is just a full category/packagename.

Examples:
.nf
.I 	sys\-apps/sed
.I 	sys\-libs/zlib
.I 	net\-misc/dhcp
.fi
.TP
.B Atom Versions
It is nice to be more specific and say that only certain versions of atoms are
acceptable.  Note that versions must be combined with a prefix (see below).  
Hence you may add a version number as a postfix to the base.

Examples:
.nf
	sys\-apps/sed\fI\-4.0.5\fR
	sys\-libs/zlib\fI\-1.1.4\-r1\fR
	net\-misc/dhcp\fI\-3.0_p2\fR
.fi

Versions are normally made up of two or three numbers separated by periods, such
as 1.2 or 4.5.2.  This string may be followed by a character such as 1.2a or 
4.5.2z.  Note that this letter is \fInot\fR meant to indicate alpha, beta,
etc... status.  For that, use the optional suffix; either _alpha, _beta, _pre 
(pre\-release), _rc (release candidate), or _p (patch).  This means for the 
3rd pre\-release of a package, you would use something like 1.2_pre3.  The 
suffixes here can be arbitrarily chained without limitation.
.TP
.B Atom Prefix Operators [> >= = <= <]
Sometimes you want to be able to depend on general versions rather than specifying
exact versions all the time.  Hence we provide standard boolean operators:

Examples:
.nf
	\fI>\fRmedia\-libs/libgd\-1.6
	\fI>=\fRmedia\-libs/libgd\-1.6
	\fI=\fRmedia\-libs/libgd\-1.6
	\fI<=\fRmedia\-libs/libgd\-1.6
	\fI<\fRmedia\-libs/libgd\-1.6
.fi
.TP
.B Extended Atom Prefixes [!~] and Postfixes [*]
Now to get even fancier, we provide the ability to define blocking packages and
version range matching.  Also note that these extended prefixes/postfixes may
be combined in any way with the atom classes defined above.
.RS
.TP
.I ~
means match any revision of the base version specified.  So in the
example below, we would match versions '1.0.2a', '1.0.2a\-r1', '1.0.2a\-r2',
etc...

Example:
.nf
	\fI~\fRnet\-libs/libnet\-1.0.2a
.fi
.TP
.I !
means block packages from being installed at the same time.

Example:
.nf
	\fI!\fRapp\-text/dos2unix
.fi
.TP
.I !!
means block packages from being installed at the same time
and explicitly disallow them from being temporarily installed
simultaneously during a series of upgrades. This syntax is supported
beginning with \fBEAPI 2\fR.

Example:
.nf
	\fI!!\fR<sys\-apps/portage\-2.1.4_rc1
.fi
.TP
.I *
means match any version of the package so long
as the specified string prefix is matched. So with a
version of '2*', we can match '2.1', '2.2', '2.2.1',
etc... and not match version '1.0', '3.0', '4.1', etc...
Beware that, due to the string matching nature, '20'
will also be matched by '2*'. The version part
that comes before the '*' must be a valid version in the absence of the '*'.
For example, '2' is a valid version and '2.' is not. Therefore, '2*' is
allowed and '2.*' is not.

Examples:
.nf
	=dev\-libs/glib\-2\fI*\fR
	\fI!\fR=net\-fs/samba\-2\fI*\fR
.fi
.RE
.TP
.B Atom Slots
Beginning with \fBEAPI 1\fR, any atom can be constrained to match a specific
\fBSLOT\fR. This is accomplished by appending a colon followed by a
\fBSLOT\fR:

Examples:
.nf
	x11\-libs/qt:3
	\fI~\fRx11\-libs/qt-3.3.8:3
	\fI>=\fRx11\-libs/qt-3.3.8:3
	\fI=\fRx11\-libs/qt-3.3*:3
.fi
.TP
.B Sub Slots
Beginning with \fBEAPI 5\fR, a slot dependency may contain an
optional sub\-slot part that follows the regular slot and is
delimited by a \fI/\fR character.

Examples:
.nf
	dev\-libs/icu:0/0
	dev\-libs/icu:0/49
	dev\-lang/perl:0/5.12
	dev\-libs/glib:2/2.30
.fi
.TP
.B Atom Slot Operators
Beginning with \fBEAPI 5\fR, slot operator dependency consists
of a colon followed by one of the following operators:
.RS
.TP
.I *
Indicates that any slot value is acceptable. In addition,
for runtime dependencies, indicates that the package will not
break if the matched package is uninstalled and replaced by
a different matching package in a different slot.

Examples:
.nf
	dev\-libs/icu:*
	dev\-lang/perl:*
	dev-libs/glib:*
.fi
.TP
.I =
Indicates that any slot value is acceptable. In addition,
for runtime dependencies, indicates that the package will
break unless a matching package with slot and sub\-slot equal
to the slot and sub\-slot of the best installed version at the
time the package was installed is available.

Examples:
.nf
	dev\-libs/icu:=
	dev\-lang/perl:=
	dev-libs/glib:=
.fi
.TP
.I slot=
Indicates that only a specific slot value is acceptable, and
otherwise behaves identically to the plain equals slot operator.

Examples:
.nf
	dev\-libs/icu:0=
	dev\-lang/perl:0=
	dev-libs/glib:2=
.fi
.PP
To implement the equals slot operator, the package manager
will need to store the slot/sub\-slot pair of the best installed
version of the matching package. This syntax is only for package
manager use and must not be used by ebuilds. The package manager
may do this by inserting the appropriate slot/sub\-slot pair
between the colon and equals sign when saving the package's
dependencies. The sub\-slot part must not be omitted here
(when the SLOT variable omits the sub\-slot part, the package
is considered to have an implicit sub\-slot which is equal to
the regular slot).

Examples:
.nf
	dev\-libs/icu:0/0=
	dev\-libs/icu:0/49=
	dev\-lang/perl:0/5.12=
	dev-libs/glib:2/2.30=
.fi
.RE
.TP
.B Atom USE
Beginning with \fBEAPI 2\fR, any atom can be constrained to match specific
\fBUSE\fR flag settings. When used together with \fBSLOT\fR dependencies,
\fBUSE\fR dependencies appear on the right hand side of \fBSLOT\fR
dependencies.

.RE
.TP
.B Atom USE defaults
Beginning with \fBEAPI 4\fR, \fBUSE\fR dependencies may specify default
assumptions about values for flags that may or may not be missing from
the \fBIUSE\fR of the matched package. Such defaults are specified by
immediately following a flag with either \fI(+)\fR or \fI(\-)\fR. Use
\fI(+)\fR to behave as if a missing flag is present and enabled, or
\fI(\-)\fR to behave as if it is present and disabled:

Examples:
.nf
	media\-video/ffmpeg[threads(+)]
	media\-video/ffmpeg[-threads(\-)]
.fi
.TP
.B Dynamic Dependencies
Sometimes programs may depend on different things depending on the USE
variable.  Portage offers a few options to handle this.  Note that when
using the following syntaxes, each case is considered as 1 Atom in the
scope it appears.  That means that each Atom both conditionally include
multiple Atoms and be nested to an infinite depth.
.RS
.TP
.B usevar? ( Atom )
To include the jpeg library when the user has jpeg in \fBUSE\fR, simply use the
following syntax:

jpeg? ( media\-libs/jpeg )
.TP
.B !usevar? ( Atom )
If you want to include a package only if the user does not have a certain option
in their \fBUSE\fR variable, then use the following syntax:

!nophysfs? ( dev\-games/physfs )

This is often useful for those times when you want to want to add optional support
for a feature and have it enabled by default.
.TP
.B usevar? ( Atom if true ) !usevar? ( Atom if false )
For functionality like the tertiary operator found in C you must use
two statements, one normal and one inverted.  If a package uses
GTK2 or GTK1, but not both, then you can handle that like this:

gtk2? ( =x11\-libs/gtk+\-2* ) !gtk2? ( =x11\-libs/gtk+\-1* )

That way the default is the superior GTK2 library.
.TP
.B || ( Atom Atom ... )
When a package can work with a few different packages but a virtual is not
appropriate, this syntax can easily be used.

Example:
.nf
|| (
	app\-games/unreal\-tournament
	app\-games/unreal\-tournament\-goty
)
.fi

Here we see that unreal\-tournament has a normal version and it has a goty
version.  Since they provide the same base set of files, another package can
use either.  Adding a virtual is inappropriate due to the small scope of it.

Another good example is when a package can be built with multiple video
interfaces, but it can only ever have just one.

Example:
.nf
|| (
	sdl? ( media\-libs/libsdl )
	svga? ( media\-libs/svgalib )
	opengl? ( virtual/opengl )
	ggi? ( media\-libs/libggi )
	virtual/x11
)
.fi

Here only one of the packages will be chosen, and the order of preference is
determined by the order in which they appear.  So sdl has the best chance of
being chosen, followed by svga, then opengl, then ggi, with a default of X if
the user does not specify any of the previous choices.

Note that if any of the packages listed are already merged, the package manager
will use that to consider the dependency satisfied.

.SS "Cross-compilation"
Portage supports cross-compilation into a subdirectory specified by \fBROOT\fR.
.TP
.B Host
\fIHost\fR in this context means the platform hosting the build process, i.e.
what autotools calls CBUILD.
Its packages are contained in the root of the filesystem ("\fI/\fR").

If \fBROOT\fR is "\fI/\fR", all dependency types will be installed there.
Otherwise, for EAPIs that support \fBHDEPEND\fR (experimental
\fBEAPI 5-hdepend\fR), only \fBHDEPEND\fR is installed into "\fI/\fR".
For EAPIs that do not support \fBHDEPEND\fR, the behaviour is controlled by the
\fI\-\-root-deps\fR flag to \fBemerge\fR(1), defaulting to install only
\fBDEPEND\fR into the \fIhost\fR.
.TP
.B Target
\fITarget\fR refers to the platform that the package will later run on, i.e.
what autotools calls CHOST.
The directory housing this system is specified by \fBROOT\fR.
If it is different from "\fI/\fR", i.e. \fIhost\fR and \fItarget\fR are not the
same, this variable contains the path to the directory housing the \fItarget\fR
system.

For EAPIs that support \fBHDEPEND\fR (experimental \fBEAPI 5-hdepend\fR),
\fBDEPEND\fR, \fBRDEPEND\fR, and \fBPDEPEND\fR
list the \fItarget\fR dependencies, i.e. those to be installed into \fBROOT\fR.
For EAPIs that do not support \fBHDEPEND\fR, the \fBemerge\fR(1) flag
\fI\-\-root-deps\fR controls what the package manager installs there.
Without it, \fBemerge\fR defaults to install only runtime dependencies (i.e.
\fBRDEPEND\fR and \fBPDEPEND\fR) into \fBROOT\fR.
.PP
See section \fBVARIABLES\fR for more information about the \fBDEPEND\fR,
\fBRDEPEND\fR and \fBHDEPEND\fR variables.
.TP
.B The targetroot USE flag
For EAPIs that support the "\fItargetroot\fR" USE flag, that flag is
automatically enabled by the package manager if \fIhost\fR and \fItarget\fR
system are not the same, i.e. if the \fBROOT\fR is not "\fI/\fR".
This is necessary where the package to be built needs an executable copy of
itself during the build process.
A known example is dev-lang/python, which needs to run a Python interpreter
during compilation.

.SH "VARIABLES"
.TP
.B Usage Notes
\- All variables defined in \fBmake.conf\fR(5) are available for use in
ebuilds (such as the PORTAGE* and PORTDIR* variables)
.br
\- When assigning values to variables in ebuilds, you \fIcannot have a
space\fR between the variable name and the equal sign.
.br
\- Variable values should only contain characters that are members of the
\fBascii\fR(7) character set. This requirement is mandated by \fBGLEP 31\fR.
.TP
.B P
This variable contains the package name without the ebuild revision.
This variable must NEVER be modified.

xfree\-4.2.1\-r2.ebuild \-\-> $P=='xfree\-4.2.1'
.TP
.B PN
Contains the name of the script without the version number.

xfree\-4.2.1\-r2.ebuild \-\-> $PN=='xfree'
.TP
.B PV
Contains the version number without the revision.

xfree\-4.2.1\-r2.ebuild \-\-> $PV=='4.2.1'
.TP
.B PR
Contains the revision number or 'r0' if no revision number exists.

xfree\-4.2.1\-r2.ebuild \-\-> $PR=='r2'

xfree\-4.2.1\-r2.ebuild \-\-> $PF=='xfree\-4.2.1\-r2'
.TP
.B CATEGORY
Contains the package category name.
.TP
.B A
Contains all source files required for the package.  This variable must
not be defined. It is autogenerated from the \fBSRC_URI\fR variable.
.TP
.B WORKDIR\fR = \fI"${PORTAGE_TMPDIR}/portage/${CATEGORY}/${PF}/work"
Contains the path to the package build root.  Do not modify this variable.
.TP
.B FILESDIR\fR = \fI"${PORTDIR}/${CATEGORY}/${PN}/files"
Contains the path to the 'files' sub folder in the package specific
location in the portage tree.  Do not modify this variable.
.TP
.B EBUILD_PHASE
Contains the abreviated name of the phase function that is
currently executing, such as "setup", "unpack", "compile", or
"preinst".
.TP
.B EBUILD_PHASE_FUNC
Beginning with \fBEAPI 5\fR, contains the full name of the phase
function that is currently executing, such as "pkg_setup",
"src_unpack", "src_compile", or "pkg_preinst".
.TP
.B EPREFIX
Beginning with \fBEAPI 3\fR, contains the offset
that this Portage was configured for during
installation.  The offset is sometimes necessary in an ebuild or eclass,
and is available in such cases as ${EPREFIX}.  EPREFIX does not contain
a trailing slash, therefore an absent offset is represented by the empty
string.  Do not modify this variable.
.TP
.B S\fR = \fI"${WORKDIR}/${P}"
Contains the path to the temporary \fIbuild directory\fR.  This variable
is used by the functions \fIsrc_compile\fR and \fIsrc_install\fR.  Both
are executed with \fIS\fR as the current directory.  This variable may
be modified to match the extraction directory of a tarball for the package.
.TP
.B T\fR = \fI"${PORTAGE_TMPDIR}/portage/${CATEGORY}/${PF}/temp"
Contains the path to a \fItemporary directory\fR.  You may use this for
whatever you like.
.TP
.B D\fR = \fI"${PORTAGE_TMPDIR}/portage/${CATEGORY}/${PF}/image/"
Contains the path to the temporary \fIinstall directory\fR.  Every write
operation that does not involve the helper tools and functions (found below)
should be prefixed with ${D}.
Beginning with \fBEAPI 3\fR, the offset prefix often needs
to be taken into account here, for which the variable
${ED} is provided (see below).
Do not modify this variable.
.TP
.B ED\fR = \fI"${PORTAGE_TMPDIR}/portage/${CATEGORY}/${PF}/image/${EPREFIX}/"
Beginning with \fBEAPI 3\fR, contains the path
"${D%/}${EPREFIX}/" for convenience purposes.
For EAPI values prior to \fBEAPI 3\fR which do
not support ED, helpers use \fBD\fR where
they would otherwise use ED.
Do not modify this variable.
.TP
.B MERGE_TYPE
Beginning with \fBEAPI 4\fR, the MERGE_TYPE variable can be used to
query the current merge type. This variable will contain one of the
following possible values:

.RS
.TS

.RE
.TP
.B PORTAGE_LOG_FILE
Contains the path of the build log. If \fBPORT_LOGDIR\fR variable is unset then
PORTAGE_LOG_FILE=\fI"${T}/build.log"\fR.
.TP
.B REPLACED_BY_VERSION
Beginning with \fBEAPI 4\fR, the REPLACED_BY_VERSION variable can be
used in pkg_prerm and pkg_postrm to query the package version that
is replacing the current package. If there is no replacement package,
the variable will be empty, otherwise it will contain a single version
number.
.TP
.B REPLACING_VERSIONS
Beginning with \fBEAPI 4\fR, the REPLACING_VERSIONS variable can be
used in pkg_pretend, pkg_setup, pkg_preinst and pkg_postinst to query
the package version(s) that the current package is replacing. If there
are no packages to replace, the variable will be empty, otherwise it
will contain a space\-separated list of version numbers corresponding
to the package version(s) being replaced. Typically, this variable will
not contain more than one version, but according to PMS it can contain
more.
.TP
.B ROOT\fR = \fI"/"
Contains the path that portage should use as the root of the live filesystem.
When packages wish to make changes to the live filesystem, they should do so in
the tree prefixed by ${ROOT}.  Often the offset prefix needs to be taken
into account here, for which the variable ${EROOT} is provided (see
below).  Do not modify this variable.
.TP
.B EROOT\fR = \fI"${ROOT%/}${EPREFIX}/"
Beginning with \fBEAPI 3\fR, contains
"${ROOT%/}${EPREFIX}/" for convenience
purposes. Do not modify this variable.
.TP
.B DESCRIPTION\fR = \fI"A happy little package"
Should contain a short description of the package.
.TP
.B EAPI\fR = \fI"0"
Defines the ebuild API version to which this package conforms. If not
defined then it defaults to "0". If portage does not recognize the
EAPI value then it will mask the package and refuse to perform any
operations with it since this means that a newer version of portage
needs to be installed first. For maximum backward compatiblity, a
package should conform to the lowest possible EAPI. Note that anyone
who uses the \fBebuild\fR(1) and \fBrepoman\fR(1) commands with this
package will be required to have a version of portage that recognizes
the EAPI to which this package conforms.
.TP
.B SRC_URI\fR = \fI"http://example.com/path/${P}.tar.gz"
Contains a list of URIs for the required source files.  It can contain
multiple URIs for a single source file.  The list is processed in order
if the file was not found on any of the \fIGENTOO_MIRRORS\fR.
Beginning with \fBEAPI 2\fR, the output file name of a given URI may be
customized with a "->" operator on the right hand side, followed by the
desired output file name. All tokens, including the operator and output
file name, should be separated by whitespace.
.TP
.B HOMEPAGE\fR = \fI"http://example.com/"
Should contain a list of URIs for the sources main sites and other further
package dependent information.
.TP
.B KEYWORDS\fR = \fI[\-~][x86,ppc,sparc,mips,alpha,arm,hppa]
Should contain appropriate list of arches that the ebuild is know to
work/not work.  By default if you do not know if an ebuild runs under
a particular arch simply omit that KEYWORD.  If the ebuild will not
work on that arch include it as \-ppc for example.  If the ebuild is
being submitted for inclusion, it must have ~arch set for architectures
where it has been PROVEN TO WORK.  (Packages KEYWORDed this way may be
unmasked for testing by setting ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~arch" on the command
line, or in \fBmake.conf\fR(5)) For an authoritative list please review
/usr/portage/profiles/arch.list.  Please keep this list in alphabetical order.
.TP
.B SLOT
This sets the SLOT for packages that may need to have multiple versions
co\-exist.  By default you should set \fBSLOT\fR="0".  If you are unsure, then
do not fiddle with this until you seek some guidance from some guru.  This
value should \fINEVER\fR be left undefined.

Beginning with \fBEAPI 5\fR, the SLOT variable may contain
an optional sub\-slot part that follows the regular slot and
is delimited by a / character. The sub\-slot must be a valid
slot name. The sub\-slot is used to represent cases in which
an upgrade to a new version of a package with a different
sub\-slot may require dependent packages to be rebuilt. When
the sub\-slot part is omitted from the SLOT definition, the
package is considered to have an implicit sub\-slot which is
equal to the regular slot. Refer to the \fBAtom Slot
Operators\fR section for more information about sub\-slot
usage.
.TP
.B LICENSE
This should be a space delimited list of licenses that the package falls
under.  This \fB_must_\fR be set to a matching license in
/usr/portage/licenses/. If the license does not exist in portage yet, you
must add it first.
.TP
.B IUSE
This should be a list of any and all USE flags that are leveraged within
your build script.  The only USE flags that should not be listed here are
arch related flags (see \fBKEYWORDS\fR). Beginning with \fBEAPI 1\fR, it
is possible to prefix flags with + or - in order to create default settings
that respectively enable or disable the corresponding \fBUSE\fR flags. For
details about \fBUSE\fR flag stacking order, refer to the \fBUSE_ORDER\fR
variable in \fBmake.conf\fR(5). Given the default \fBUSE_ORDER\fR setting,
negative IUSE default settings are effective only for negation of
repo\-level USE settings, since profile and user configuration settings
override them.
.TP
.B DEPEND
This should contain a list of all packages that are required for the program
to compile (aka \fIbuildtime\fR dependencies).  These are usually libraries and
headers.

Starting from experimental \fBEAPI 5-hdepend\fR, tools should go into the
\fBHDEPEND\fR variable instead, as \fBDEPEND\fR will only be installed into the
\fItarget\fR system and hence cannot be executed in a cross\-compile setting.
(See section \fBCross\-compilation\fR for more information.)

You may use the syntax described above in the \fBDependencies\fR section.
.TP
.B RDEPEND
This should contain a list of all packages that are required for this
program to run (aka \fIruntime\fR dependencies).  These are usually libraries.

In \fBEAPI 3\fR or earlier, if this is not set, then it defaults to the value
of \fBDEPEND\fR. In \fBEAPI 4\fR or later, \fBRDEPEND\fR will never be
implicitly set.

You may use the syntax described above in the \fBDependencies\fR section.
.TP
.B HDEPEND
This should contain a list of all packages that are required to be executable
during compilation of this program (aka \fIhost\fR buildtime dependencies).
These are usually tools, like interpreters or (cross\-)compilers.

This variable is new in experimental \fBEAPI 5-hdepend\fR and will be installed
into the \fIhost\fR system.
(See section \fBCross-compilation\fR for more information.)

You may use the syntax described above in the \fBDependencies\fR section.
.TP
.B PDEPEND
This should contain a list of all packages that should be merged after this
one (aka \fIpost\fR merge dependencies), but which may be installed by the
package manager at any time, if that is not possible.

.B ***WARNING***
.br
Use this only as last resort to break cyclic dependencies!

You may use the syntax described above in the \fBDependencies\fR section.
.TP
.B REQUIRED_USE
Beginning with \fBEAPI 4\fR, the \fBREQUIRED_USE\fR variable can be
used to specify combinations of \fBUSE\fR flags that are allowed
or not allowed. Elements can be nested when necessary.

.SS "QA Control Variables:"
.TP
.B Usage Notes
Several QA variables are provided which allow an ebuild to manipulate some
of the QA checks performed by portage.  Use of these variables in ebuilds
should be kept to an absolute minimum otherwise they defeat the purpose
of the QA checks, and their use is subject to agreement of the QA team.
They are primarily intended for use by ebuilds that install closed\-source
binary objects that cannot be altered.

Note that objects that violate these rules may fail on some architectures.
.TP
.B QA_PREBUILT
This should contain a list of file paths, relative to the image
directory, of files that are pre\-built binaries. Paths
listed here will be appended to each of the QA_* variables
listed below. The paths may contain fnmatch\-like patterns
which will be internally translated to regular expressions for
the QA_* variables that support regular expressions instead
of fnmatch patterns. The translation mechanism simply replaces
"*" with ".*".
.TP
.B QA_TEXTRELS
This variable can be set to a list of file paths, relative to the image
directory, of files that contain text relocations that cannot be eliminated.
The paths may contain fnmatch patterns.

This variable is intended to be used on closed\-source binary objects that
cannot be altered.
.TP
.B QA_EXECSTACK
This should contain a list of file paths, relative to the image directory, of
objects that require executable stack in order to run.
The paths may contain fnmatch patterns.

This variable is intended to be used on objects that truly need executable
stack (i.e. not those marked to need it which in fact do not).
.TP
.B QA_WX_LOAD
This should contain a list of file paths, relative to the image directory, of
files that contain writable and executable segments.  These are rare.
The paths may contain fnmatch patterns.
.TP
.B QA_FLAGS_IGNORED
This should contain a list of file paths, relative to the image directory, of
files that do not contain .GCC.command.line sections or contain .hash sections.
The paths may contain regular expressions with escape\-quoted special characters.

This variable is intended to be used on files of binary packages which ignore
CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, FFLAGS, FCFLAGS, and LDFLAGS variables.
.TP
.B QA_MULTILIB_PATHS
This should contain a list of file paths, relative to the image directory, of
files that should be ignored for the multilib\-strict checks.
The paths may contain regular expressions with escape\-quoted special characters.
.TP
.B QA_PRESTRIPPED
This should contain a list of file paths, relative to the image directory, of
files that contain pre-stripped binaries. The paths may contain regular
expressions with escape\-quoted special characters.

.B QA_SONAME
This should contain a list of file paths, relative to the image directory, of
shared libraries that lack SONAMEs. The paths may contain regular expressions
with escape\-quoted special characters.
.TP
.B QA_SONAME_NO_SYMLINK
This should contain a list of file paths, relative to the image directory, of
shared libraries that have SONAMEs but should not have a corresponding SONAME
symlink in the same directory. The paths may contain regular expressions
with escape\-quoted special characters.
.TP
.B QA_DT_NEEDED
This should contain a list of file paths, relative to the image directory, of
shared libraries that lack NEEDED entries. The paths may contain regular

.SH "PORTAGE DECLARATIONS"
.TP
.B inherit
Inherit is portage's maintenance of extra classes of functions that are
external to ebuilds and provided as inheritable capabilities and data. They
define functions and set data types as drop\-in replacements, expanded, and
simplified routines for extremely common tasks to streamline the build
process. Call to inherit cannot depend on conditions which can vary in given
ebuild. Specification of the eclasses contains only their name and not the
\fI.eclass\fR extension. Also note that the inherit statement must come
before other variable declarations unless these variables are used in global
scope of eclasses.

.SH "PHASE FUNCTIONS"

.B pkg_pretend
Beginning with \fBEAPI 4\fR, this function can be defined in order to
check that miscellaneous requirements are met. It is called as early
as possible, before any attempt is made to satisfy dependencies. If the
function detects a problem then it should call eerror and die. The
environment (variables, functions, temporary directories, etc..) that
is used to execute pkg_pretend is not saved and therefore is not
available in phases that execute afterwards.
.TP
.B pkg_nofetch
This function will be executed when the files in \fBSRC_URI\fR
cannot be fetched for any reason. If you turn on \fIfetch\fR in

has no effect. For example, with \fBEAPI 2\fR, a manpage named
foo.\fI<locale>\fR.1 will be installed as
/usr/share/man/\fI<locale>\fR/man1/foo.1. Beginning with \fBEAPI 4\fR,
the \fI\-i18n\fR option takes precedence over the locale suffix of the
file name.

.B dohard\fR \fI<filename> <linkname>
Beginning with \fBEAPI 4\fR, the \fBdohard\fR helper no longer exists. Ebuilds
should call \fBln(1)\fR directly.
.TP
.B dosym\fR \fI<filename> <linkname>
.PD 1
Performs the ln command to create a symlink.
.TP
.B doheader\fR \fI[\-r] <file> [list of more files]
Installs the given header files into /usr/include/, by default
with file mode \fI0644\fR (this can be overridden with the
\fBinsopts\fR function). Setting \-r sets recursive. The
\fBdoheader\fR helper is available beginning with \fBEAPI 5\fR.
.TP
.B dohtml\fR \fI [\-a filetypes] [\-r] [\-x list\-of\-dirs\-to\-ignore] [list\-of\-files\-and\-dirs]
Installs the files in the list of files (space\-separated list) into
/usr/share/doc/${PF}/html provided the file ends in .htm, .html, .css, .js, .gif, .jpeg, .jpg, or .png.
Setting \fI\-a\fR limits what types of files will be included,
\fI\-A\fR appends to the default list, setting \fI\-x\fR sets which dirs to
exclude (CVS excluded by default), \fI\-p\fR sets a document prefix, \fI\-r\fR sets recursive.
.TP
.B doinfo\fR \fI<info\-file> [list of more info\-files]
Installs info\-pages into \fIDESTDIR\fR/info.  Files are automatically
gzipped.  Creates all necessary dirs.
.TP
.B domo\fR \fI<locale\-file> [list of more locale\-files]
Installs locale\-files into \fIDESTDIR\fR/usr/share/locale/[LANG]
depending on local\-file's ending.  Creates all necessary dirs.

.PD 0
.TP
.B fowners\fR \fI<permissions> <file> [files]
.TP
.B fperms\fR \fI<permissions> <file> [files]
.PD 1
Performs chown (\fBfowners\fR) or chmod (\fBfperms\fR), applying
\fIpermissions\fR to \fIfiles\fR.
.TP
.B insinto\fR \fI[path]
Sets the destination path for the \fBdoins\fR function.
.br
The default path is /.
.TP
.B insopts\fR \fI[options for install(1)]
Can be used to define options for the install function used in
\fBdoins\fR.  The default is \fI\-m0644\fR.
.TP
.B doins\fR \fI[\-r] <file> [list of more files]
Installs files into the path controlled by \fBinsinto\fR.  This function
uses \fBinstall\fR(1).  Creates all necessary dirs.
Setting \-r sets recursive. Beginning with \fBEAPI 4\fR, both
\fBdoins\fR and \fBnewins\fR preserve symlinks. In \fBEAPI 3\fR and
earlier, symlinks are dereferenced rather than preserved.
.TP
.B exeinto\fR \fI[path]
Sets the destination path for the \fBdoexe\fR function.
.br
The default path is /.
.TP
.B exeopts\fR \fI[options for install(1)]
Can be used to define options for the install function used in \fBdoexe\fR.
The default is \fI\-m0755\fR.
.TP
.B doexe\fR \fI<executable> [list of more executables]
Installs executables into the path controlled by \fBexeinto\fR.  This function
uses \fBinstall\fR(1).  Creates all necessary dirs.
.TP
.B docinto\fR \fI[path]
Sets the subdir used by \fBdodoc\fR and \fBdohtml\fR
when installing into the document tree
(based in /usr/share/doc/${PF}/).  Default is no subdir, or just "".
.TP
.B dodoc\fR \fI[-r] <document> [list of more documents]
Installs a document or a list of documents into /usr/share/doc/${PF}/\fI<docinto path>\fR.
Documents are marked for compression.  Creates all necessary dirs.
Beginning with \fBEAPI 4\fR, there is support for recursion, enabled by the
new \fI\-r\fR option.

.PD 1
All these functions act like the do* functions, but they only work with one
file and the file is installed as \fI[new filename]\fR.
Beginning with \fBEAPI 5\fR, standard input is read when the
first parameter is \- (a hyphen).
