NAME
       quickpkg - creates portage packages

SYNOPSIS
       quickpkg [options] <list of packages or package-sets>

DESCRIPTION
       quickpkg  can  be  utilized  to  quickly  create  a  package for portage by utilizing the files already on your filesystem.  This package then can be emerged on any system.  To review syntax for emerging binary packages, review
       emerge(1).  The upside of this process is that you don't have to wait for the package to unpack, configure, compile, and install before you can have the package ready to go.  The downside is that the package  will  contain  the
       files that exist on your filesystem even if they have modified since they were first installed.
       The packages, after being created, will be placed in PKGDIR.  This variable is defined in make.conf(5) and defaults to /var/cache/binpkgs.

OPTIONS
       <list of packages or package-sets>
              Each  package  in  the  list can be of two forms.  First you can give it the full path to the installed entry in the virtual database.  That is, /var/db/pkg/<CATEGORY>/<PKG-VERSION>/.  The second form is a portage depend
              atom or a portage package set.  The atom or set is of the same form that you would give emerge if you wanted to emerge something.  See ebuild(5) for full definition.

       --ignore-default-opts
              Causes the QUICKPKG_DEFAULT_OPTS environment variable to be ignored.

       --include-config < y | n >
              Include all files protected by CONFIG_PROTECT (as a security precaution, default is 'n').

       --include-unmodified-config < y | n >
              Include files protected by CONFIG_PROTECT that have not been modified since installation (as a security precaution, default is 'n').

       --umask=UMASK
              The umask used during package creation (default is 0077).

EXAMPLES
       quickpkg /var/db/pkg/dev-python/pyogg-1.1
       quickpkg planeshift
       quickpkg =apache-1.3.27-r1
       quickpkg =net-www/apache-2*
       quickpkg @system
