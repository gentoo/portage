              Enable deletion of unused distfiles.

       --deletion-db=FILE
              Database file used to track lifetime of files scheduled for delayed deletion.

       --deletion-delay=SECONDS
              Delay time for deletion of unused distfiles, measured in seconds.

       --temp-dir=DIR
              Temporary directory for downloads.

       --restrict-mirror-exemptions=RESTRICT_MIRROR_EXEMPTIONS
              Comma delimited list of mirror targets for which to ignore RESTRICT="mirror" (see ebuild(5)).

       --recycle-db=FILE
              Database file used to track lifetime of files in recycle dir.

       --recycle-deletion-delay=SECONDS
              Delay time for deletion of unused files from recycle dir, measured in seconds (defaults to the equivalent of 60 days).

       --fetch-log-dir=DIR
              Directory for individual fetch logs.

       --whitelist-from=FILE
              Specifies a file containing a list of files to whitelist, one per line, # prefixed lines ignored. Use this option multiple times in order to specify multiple whitelists.

       --symlinks
              Use symbolic links to link distfiles to the primary layout from other specified layouts. If not specified, hard links are used instead.

       --layout-conf=FILE
              Specifies alternate mirror layout.conf file to use in order to select the desired distfile layout. If not specified, layout.conf in --distfiles directory will be used if present, otherwise flat layout will be assumed.
