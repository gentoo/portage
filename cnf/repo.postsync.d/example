# and they will not be passed any parameters.

# On a repo.postsync.d hook call, positional parameters contain
# information about the just-synced repository.

# Your hook can control it's actions depending on any of the three
# parameters passed in to it.

# They are as follows:
#
# The repository name.
repository_name=${1}
# The URI to which the repository was synced.

# The path to the repository.

# explicit exit is done, the exit code is the exit code of last spawned
# command. Since our script is a bit more complex, we want to control
# the exit code explicitly.
