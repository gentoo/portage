About Portage
=============

Portage is a package management system based on ports collections. The
Package Manager Specification Project (PMS) standardises and documents
the behaviour of Portage so that ebuild repositories can be used by other
package managers.


Dependencies
============

Python and Bash should be the only hard dependencies. Python 2.7 is the
minimum supported version.
