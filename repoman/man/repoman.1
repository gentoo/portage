.TH "REPOMAN" "1" "Jun 2017" "Repoman VERSION" "Repoman"
.SH NAME
repoman \- Gentoo's program to enforce a minimal level of quality assurance in
packages added to the portage tree
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrepoman\fR [\fIoption\fR] [\fImode\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR "Quality is job zero."

.BR repoman
checks the quality of ebuild repositories.

Note: \fBrepoman commit\fR only works \fIinside local\fR cvs, git, or
subversion repositories.

Note: Messages pertaining to specific lines may be inaccurate in the
prescence of continuation lines from use of the \fI\\\fR character in
BASH.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-a\fR, \fB--ask\fR
Request a confirmation before commiting
.TP
\fB-b\fR, \fB--bug\fR
Include a bug reference in the commit message footer. The argument can
be either a Gentoo bug number or a full bug URL (either Gentoo
or upstream). Gentoo bug URLs are automatically shortened to
the canonical \fBhttps://bugs.gentoo.org/NNNNNN\fR form, and HTTPS
is forced for known bug trackers.

When pushing to the Gentoo repository, the reference to the commit
will be automatically added as a comment on the bug.
.TP
\fB-c\fR, \fB--closes\fR
Include a \fBCloses\fR tag in the commit message footer that can be used
to close bugs and pull requests. The argument can be either a Gentoo bug
number or a full PR/bug URL. Gentoo bug URLs are automatically shortened
to the canonical \fBhttps://bugs.gentoo.org/NNNNNN\fR form, and HTTPS
is forced for known bug trackers.

When pushing to the Gentoo repository, the referenced bugs will be
closed as RESOLVED/FIXED automatically with a comment referencing
the commit. Furthermore, GitHub pull requests will be closed as well
due to the automatic GitHub mirroring.

Other platforms using the \fBCloses\fR tag include GitLab and Bitbucket.
.TP
\fB\-\-digest=<y|n>\fR
Automatically update Manifest digests for modified files. This
option triggers a behavior that is very similar to that enabled
by FEATURES="digest" in \fBmake.conf\fR(5). In order to enable
this behavior by default for repoman alone, add
\fB\-\-digest=y\fR to the \fIREPOMAN_DEFAULT_OPTS\fR variable in
\fBmake.conf\fR(5). The \fBmanifest\-check\fR mode will
automatically ignore the \-\-digest option.

\fBNOTE:\fR
This option does not trigger update of digests for Manifest DIST
entries that already exist. Replacement of existing Manifest
DIST entries can be forced by using the \fBmanifest\fR mode
together with the \fB\-\-force\fR option.
.TP
\fB-f\fR, \fB--force\fR
Force commit to proceed, regardless of QA issues. For convenience, this option
causes the most time consuming QA checks to be skipped. The commit message will
include an indication that this option has been enabled, together with the
usual portage version stamp.

When used together with \fBmanifest\fR mode, \fB--force\fR causes existing
digests to be replaced for any files that exist in ${DISTDIR}.
Existing digests are assumed to be correct for files that would otherwise
have to be downloaded in order to recompute digests. \fBWARNING:\fR When
replacing existing digests, it is the user's responsibility to ensure that
files contained in ${DISTDIR} have the correct identities. Especially beware
of partially downloaded files.
.TP
\fB-S\fR, \fB--straight-to-stable\fR
Allow committing straight to stable
.TP
\fB-q\fR, \fB--quiet\fR
Be less verbose about extraneous info
.TP
\fB-p\fR, \fB--pretend\fR
Don't commit or fix anything; just show what would be done
.TP
\fB-x\fR, \fB--xmlparse\fR
Forces the metadata.xml parse check to be carried out
.TP
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR
Displays every package name while checking
.TP
\fB\-\-echangelog=<y|n|force>\fR
For commit mode, call echangelog if ChangeLog is unmodified (or
regardless of modification if 'force' is specified). This option
can be enabled by default for a particular repository by setting
"update\-changelog = true" in metadata/layout.conf (see
\fBportage\fR(5)).
.TP
\fB\-\-experimental\-inherit=<y|n>\fR
Enable experimental inherit.missing checks which may misbehave when the
internal eclass database becomes outdated.
.TP
\fB\-\-if\-modified=<y|n>\fR
Only check packages that have uncommitted modifications
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\-arches\fR
Ignore arch-specific failures (where arch != host)
.TP
\fB\-\-ignore\-default\-opts\fR
Do not use the \fIREPOMAN_DEFAULT_OPTS\fR environment variable.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\-masked\fR
Ignore masked packages (not allowed with commit mode)
.TP
.BR "\-\-include\-arches " ARCHES
A space separated list of arches used to filter the selection of
profiles for dependency checks.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-include\-dev\fR
Include dev profiles in dependency checks.
.TP
\fB\-e <y|n>\fR, \fB\-\-include\-exp\-profiles=<y|n>\fR
Include exp profiles in dependency checks.
.TP
\fB\-\-unmatched\-removal\fR
Enable strict checking of package.mask and package.unmask files for
unmatched removal atoms.
.TP
\fB\-\-without\-mask\fR
Behave as if no package.mask entries exist (not allowed with commit mode)
.TP
\fB-m\fR, \fB--commitmsg\fR
Adds a commit message via the command line
.TP
\fB-M\fR, \fB--commitmsgfile\fR
Adds a commit message from the specified file.  This option also will perform
an automatic text substitution of a leading "cat/pkg: " string (upper or lower
case) with the actual category/package prefix as defined by the required message
format.  Use this option for templating a common commit message for multiple
package updates.
