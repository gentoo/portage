class EbuildIpcDaemon(FifoIpcDaemon):
    """
    This class serves as an IPC daemon, which ebuild processes can use
    to communicate with portage's main python process.

    Here are a few possible uses:

    1) Robust subshell/subprocess die support. This allows the ebuild
       environment to reliably die without having to rely on signal IPC.

    2) Delegation of portageq calls to the main python process, eliminating
       performance and userpriv permission issues.

    3) Reliable ebuild termination in cases when the ebuild has accidentally
       left orphan processes running in the background (as in bug #278895).

    4) Detect cases in which bash has exited unexpectedly (as in bug #190128).
