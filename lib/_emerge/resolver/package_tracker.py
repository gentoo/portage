    **Behavior**

    This section is intended to give you a good conceptual overview of the ``PackageTracker`` class and its general
    behavior -- how you can expect it to behave and how in turn expects to be used successfully by the programmer.

    This class is used to model the behavior of a real Gentoo or other system using Portage for package management,
    along with the installed and to-be-installed packages. The installed packages are ones that are already on the
    system and recorded in ``/var/db/pkg``, while the to-be-installed packages are a group of packages that Portage is
    considering installing on the system, based on the information in Portage's dependency graph. Multiple roots are
    supported, so that situations can be modeled where ROOT is set to a non-default value (non-``/``).

    You can use the add_pkg() method to add a to-be-merged package to the PackageTracker, and ``add_installed_pkg()`` to
    add an already-installed package to the package tracker. Typical use of the package tracker involves the
    ``depgraph.py`` code populating the package tracker with calls to ``add_installed_pkg()`` to add all installed
    packages on the system, and then it is initialized and ready for use. At that point, ``depgraph.py`` can use
    ``add_pkg()`` to add to-be-installed packages to the system.

    It's worth mentioning that ``PackageTracker`` uses ``Package`` objects as arguments, and stores these objects
    internally. There are parts of the code that ensure that a ``Package`` instance is added to the PackageTracker
    only once.

    Note that when a to-be-merged package is added to the package tracker via ``add_pkg()``, it will "cover up"
    (replace) any installed package that shares the same root-catpkg-slot or root-catpkg-version, meaning that calling
    the ``all_pkgs()`` or ``match()`` method will not return the installed package in the list. And the code does
    support the scenario where ``add_installed_pkg(pkg2)`` is called *after* a call to ``add_pkg(pkg1)`` -- in this
    case, if ``pkg1`` would 'cover up' ``pkg2``, this will be identified and handled correctly.

    But the package tracker is designed to have an important behavior in this regard -- because PackageTracker has a
    ``remove()`` method, these replaced/covered-up packages are not permanently removed -- so if you ``remove()`` a
    to-be-installed package that was "replacing" an installed package, the installed package will "reappear". This
    removal functionality is used by the slot conflict code in ``depgraph.py`` to modify the list of to-be-installed
    packages as it addresses slot conflicts.

    One of the main purposes of the PackageTracker is to detect conflicts between packages. Conflicts are detected
    on to-be-installed packages only.

    A slot conflict is a situation where a to-be-installed package is added to the package tracker via ``add_pkg()``,
    and there is already a to-be-installed package added that has the same root, catpkg and slot. These cannot co-exist.

    A cpv conflict is a situation where a to-be-installed package is added to the package tracker via ``add_pkg()``, and
    there is already a to-be-installed package added that has the same root, catpkg, and version+revision. These cannot
    co-exist.

    The package tracker does not prevent slot and cpv conflicts from occurring. Instead, it allows them to be recorded
    and the ``conflicts()`` and ``slot_conflicts()`` method will cause the package tracker to look at its internal data
    structures and generate ``PackageConflict()`` objects for each conflict it finds.

    The ``match()`` method is used extensively by ``depgraph.py`` to find packages that match a particular dependency
    atom. The code now also supports soname dependencies.

    **Future Functionality**

    The package tracker may be extended in the future to track additional useful information:

    * Packages that block one another. This information is not currently injected into the package tracker.

    * Sub-slot conflicts. It is possible to identify situations where a to-be-installed package is in a new sub-slot.
      In this case, the depgraph can be queried for parents of this dependency, and these parents can be scheduled
      to be rebuilt.
